# Website Design Assignment
I received an assignment from `Brandent` to replicate the design and feel of the Bharat Lok Shiksha Parishad [website](https://ekalblspindia.org/).  

So far, I have created the header, menu, and the first two sections of the site.    

I used the following programming languages and web development technologies for this:
* - HTML,
  - CSS, and
  - Java Script

The cloned site is designed to be responsive. You can check out the site [here](https://devdeepansh.42web.io/).
